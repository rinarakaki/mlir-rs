# NNZ-statistics for direct sparse2sparse conversion

This file contains method definitions for `SparseTensorNNZ`.

This file is part of the lightweight runtime support library for sparse tensor manipulations.  The functionality of the support library is meant to simplify benchmarking, testing, and debugging MLIR code operating on sparse tensors.  However, the provided functionality is **not** part of core MLIR itself.
